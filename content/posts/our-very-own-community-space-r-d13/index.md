As we\'re launching our first Algorand product soon, we wanted to have a
space where people can reach out and talk to us.

We were a bit surprised to find that
[/r/D13](https://reddit.com/r/D13)
was available as a subreddit! We promptly claimed it and are in the
process of filling it out with some content.

If you want to ask us anything, feel free to drop by and post.
