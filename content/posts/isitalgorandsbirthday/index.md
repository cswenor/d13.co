To celebrate Algorand MainNet\'s third birthday on the 11th of June
2022, we set up a mini-project consisting of a countdown timer to the
big day: [is it algorands birthday dot
com](https://isitalgorandsbirthday.com/)
and a midi project that will be revealed there on Algorand\'s big day.

We picked June 11 from Block Zero\'s timestamp on MainNet:

\"2019-06-11T00:00:00Z\"

At midnight the countdown will transition to a web2.0 celebration
extravaganza. CSS3 is definitely invited, and even 3D may make a cameo.

For 2022, we will make 1096 copies of the fractional NFTs - one for each
day of Algorand MainNet operation. They will be available for 3 ALGO,
with a limit of 1 per account. **But,** Clockwatchers who count down the
final seconds along with us will get the NFT for free. The NFT will be
revealed at midnight.

So, be
[there](https://isitalgorandsbirthday.com/)
on June 11 2022, at midnight UTC.

We serendipitously found the following vanity address under some couch
cushions, and we will be minting this and future birthday NFTs with it.

{{< callout emoji="ðŸ”‘" text="JUNEII..CAME" >}}

The usual good-faith properties will apply on this and Future NFTs:

-   No Freeze
-   No Clawback

Additionally, all unsold NFTs will be verifiably burned on June 12th,
locking them away forever, so in all likelihood the actual circulation
will be much smaller.

Happy upcoming Birthday, Algorand. Many happy ROIs.
